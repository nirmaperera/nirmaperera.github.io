							<h4>Frontend Application</h4>
							<p> I wanted to redesign the current login and register page for <a href="https://online.nationalgridus.com/login/LoginActivate?applicurl=aHR0cHM6Ly9vbmxpbmUubmF0aW9uYWxncmlkdXMuY29tL2VzZXJ2aWNlX2VudQ==&auth_method=0">National
									Grid</a>, because I
								believed that the pages were outdated. My inspiration for the design was the ConEdison
								website. I tried my best to be consistent to the styles and colors of the existing,<a href=" https://www.nationalgridus.com/NY-Home/Default.aspx">
									National Grid website </a>. In the process of doing so, I wanted to familiarize myself with flex-box
								and SASS. After building the login and register components, I added some logic like
								user authentication, a pay bill form, state persistence, etc.

							</p>
							<hr />
							<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
							<p>
								Some of the difficulties I faced was state management, private routes, and state
								persistence. I needed a way to check if the user was logged in, and if so, change the
								navigation bar, and vice versa. Similarly, I wanted to prevent the user from accessing
								the dashboard and profile route if the user was not logged in by using private routes.
								Lastly, because the redux store gets returned to its initial state upon page refresh, I
								wanted a way to persist the state.
							</p>

							<hr />
							<h3>Project Solutions</h3>
							<p> One way I managed state was by using Redux. Although, there was some boilerplate code
								when learning redux, I found that it was easy to grasp and good to familiarize with
								when it comes to front end development. In case, the application was to scale up, using
								redux is beneficial. I solved the private route issue, by creating a PrivateRoute
								function and passing isLogged (state in redux) as a prop to PrivateRoute. Finally, I
								persisted redux state to local storage by writing two functions, one which saves the
								state to local storage, and the other which loads the state from local storage. </p>
							<hr />
							<h3>Application Features</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Registration</li>
								<li>Login</li>
								<li>User authentication</li>
								<li>Profile (change user info)</li>
								<li>Dashboard (Pay Bill)</li>
							</ul>
							<hr>
							<h3>What's Missing?</h3>
							<p> The application only contains login, register, dashboard, and profile components. It
								can scale to other components like View bill, stop and start service, etc, given the
								necessary resources and information.</p>
