							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>Frontend developer and designer</p>
							<p>
								The goal of the application was to recommend wines based on user’s preference, provide a clean web user
								interface to navigate, display information clearly, and store user's information. </p>
							<hr />
							<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
							<p> Most of the difficulties from the front end was design based, which included making the
								application responsive. In addition, learning React for the first time was challenging. As a group some
								difficulties we faced was agreeing on the stack, and deciding on recommendation algorithm </p>
							<hr />
							<h3>Project Solutions</h3>
							<p>Developer tools helped me tremendously when it came to fixing design layout bugs. When it came to react, due
								to the limited time, I decided to create react components instead using the create-react-app. For example, I
								made components from react, such as the navbar and buttons, which were components that were reusable on
								multiple pages. In addition, after some discussions around how to choose a recommendation algorithm, we decided
								to use a simple filtering method which filtered data based on user preferences (wine type, region, and
								vintage), so that we can reduce the risk of delivering a incomplete product. </p>
							<hr />
							<h3>Application Features</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Registration</li>
								<li>Login</li>
								<li>Profile</li>
								<li>take a quiz, to find wines that match your perference</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
							<h3>What's missing?</h3>
							<p>
								<li> Recommendation Algorithm- We could have implemented more complicated recommendation algorithm like
									content-based or clustering method.</li>
								<li>Recommendation History- A user can store their history of wine recommendations, so that the user can access
									these wines later on. </li>
								<li>Reviews- A user can review each recommend wine for her/him, so it generates a feedback loop to the
									database, ultimately refining the recommendation algorithm. </li>
