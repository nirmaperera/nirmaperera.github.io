                            <h3>Full Stack Application</h3>
                            <p>This project is a clone of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon </a>and a full stack
                                application. The UI design is similar
                                to Amazon using its brand colors, logos, product images as well as some animations.
                                 In addition, I wanted to familiarize myself with new technology such as <a
                                    href="https://stripe.com/"> Stripe </a>, context
                                API, and using the Cloud Firestore from firebase.

                            <h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
                            <p>
                                Some of the difficulties I faced was state management, understanding Stripe and how to
                                process customer’s payments, using express and firebase cloud functions, as well as
                                using the Cloud Firestore. For this build, I decided to use the context API for state
                                management. To process payments, I had to understand the documentation to use Stripe
                                REST API in test mode. Finally, implementing an REST API using Express with Firebase
                                cloud
                                functions also needed further reading and researching.
                            </p>

                            <hr />
                            <h3>Project Solutions</h3>
                            <p> Similar to redux, context allows us
                                to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through
                                every level of the tree, or prop drilling. For the build, context was used for holding
                                the cart state, user authentication, settings the user’s home address for delivery, etc.
                                I found that context api was a lot easier to grasp than redux, which has much less
                                boilerplate code. However, redux is still the better solution for complex state, since
                                context will trigger a re render on each update and ultimately would be difficult to
                                optimize. <br />

                                In addition, Stripe is a payment processing software and for this build, <a
                                    href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe Rest API</a>
                                was used to process payments using a paymentIntent. “A PaymentIntent guides you through
                                the process of collecting a payment from your customer”. The payment was then confirmed
                                and completed with the client secret. Once the payment was confirmed, the customer's
                                order ( products, date ordered, payment amount ) was pushed into, Cloud Firestore, a
                                real time database.<br />


                                Similarly, this was my first time using firebase, so setting up firebase tools was new
                                to me. Reading the documentation helped me understand how to read and write into
                                collections in the Firestore, especially for the user’s details (ex. home address).
                                Furthermore, express helped me host the API on a Cloud Function and then pass the
                                express
                                instance directly into the Cloud Function HTTPS handler. </p>

                            <p> Some features that would be beneficial for this build would be a dynamic rating system
                                in addition to having customers post reviews of products once logged into their account.
