                            <p>This project is a clone of amazon and a full stack application. The UI design is similar
                                to Amazon using its brand colors, logos, product images in addition to some animations.
                                Â In addition, I wanted to familiarize myself with new technology such as stripe, context
                                API, and using the Cloud Firestore from firebase.

                            <h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
                            <p>
                                Some of the difficulties I faced was state management, private routes, and state
                                persistence. I needed a way to check if the user was logged in, and if so, change the
                                navigation bar, and vice versa. Similarly, I wanted to prevent the user from accessing
                                the dashboard and profile route if the user was not logged in by using private routes.
                                Lastly, because the redux store gets returned to its initial state upon page refresh, I
                                wanted a way to persist the state.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Project Solutions</h3>
                            <p> One way I managed state was by using Redux. Although, there was some boilerplate code
                                when learning redux, I found that it was easy to grasp and good to familiarize with
                                when it comes to front end development. In case, the application was to scale up, using
                                redux is beneficial. I solved the private route issue, by creating a PrivateRoute
                                function and passing isLogged (state in redux) as a prop to PrivateRoute. Finally, I
                                persisted redux state to local storage by writing two functions, one which saves the
                                state to local storage, and the other which loads the state from local storage. </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Registration/login</li>

                            <h3>What's Missing?</h3>
                            <p> Some features that would be beneficial for this build would have dynamic rating system
                                in addition to having customers post reviews of products once logged into their account.
